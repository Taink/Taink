## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am interested in the design of complex systems.
- I am fairly proficient with the usual programming languages
  such as Java, JavaScript (+ TypeScript), Go, Python, etc.
  I'd say I am fairly confident in my ability to learn syntax provided it is readily accessible.
- I have some experience in C, C++ and Zig but I have yet to create "real" programs with them. I might also try Rust at some point.
- I am pretty good at managing a Linux-based operating system. I still have a lot to learn though.
- I want to learn more about graphics programming. I have only made simple 2D engines for now and I want to go deeper on that subject.
- I enjoy playing (mostly indie) video games. Here's my
