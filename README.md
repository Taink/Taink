## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I make Discord bots, and I occasionally test things with websites.
- Iâ€™m currently learning continuous integration and deployment,
along with Docker, Kubernetes and the like
- I have some experience with the most frequent programming languages
such as Java, C, C++, etc.
- You can reach me as **Taink#9231** on Discord, or on any of my repositories.

I enjoy playing (mostly indie) video games. Here's my 
[Steam profile](https://store.steampowered.com/)!  
I'm interested in cybersecurity, in the sense that I enjoy learning
new things on that subject
(I'm not that well informed on the subject however).

One day, I hope I will be able to make a good ~~recipe~~ program with CHEF.
